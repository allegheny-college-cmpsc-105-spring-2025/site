# Measures of Central Tendency

## Mode Definition

The most common value in a sample. Usually a measure of "central tendency".

## Mode Examples

3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9

. . .

7

. . .

8, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7

. . .

7

. . .

3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9

. . .

- Use the average in case of multiple modes, or a set with both modes
- 7.5 or {7,8}


## Median Definition

Middle value once a variable has been sorted low to high

## Median Example

::: incremental
- raw: 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 4
- sorted: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7
- 6th is middle of 11: 4
- Take mean if there are two middles
:::


## Mean Definition

Sum of all the values in a sample divided by the number of values.

$$
\bar x = {\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N} x_i \over N}
$$



# Measures of Distributions

## Range Definition

Distance between lowest and highest values in a variable (subtract high minus low)

::: incremental
- raw: 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 4
- sorted: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7
- highest: 7
- lowest: 2
- range: 7 - 2 --> 5
:::

## Quartiles Definition

The middle value (median), the middle value of the lower half (lower quartile), the middle value of the upper half (upper quartile)

::: incremental
- raw: 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 4
- sorted: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7
- middle is element 6 out of 11: 4
- lower quartile is element 3 out of 5: 3
- upper quartile is element 3 out of 5: 7
- exclude the median in calculating the uq and lq

## Box Plots {.smaller}

Visualizations of quartiles and range  (and mean and outliers)

## Box Plots {.smaller}

Sketch a box plot for the following data:

- raw: 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 4
- sorted: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7
- middle is element 6 out of 11: 4
- lq is element 3 out of 5: 3
- uq is element -3 out of 5: 7

## Variance Definition {.smaller}

Describes the spread of the data and how tightly clustered around the mean it is. 

::: incremental
- Mathematically, it is the normalized sum of squared errors.
- Errors are comparisons of each data point with the mean (subtraction)
- Squaring makes all errors positive and penalizes large errors
- Summing and normalizing is like finding the average squared error
- $\sigma^2$ represents variance
:::

. . .

$$
\sigma^2 = {\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N}(x_i - \bar x)^2 \over N-1}
$$


## Standard Deviation Definition {.smaller}

Square root of variance. Describes the spread of the data and how tightly clustered around the mean it is.

. . .

$$
\sigma^2 = {\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N}(x_i - \bar x)^2 \over N-1}
$$
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{N}(x_i - \bar x)^2 \over N-1}
$$

## Visualizations of Standard Deviation {.smaller}

- small STD --> narrow distribution of data, most is close to the mean
- large STD --> wide distribution of data, a lot is not close to the mean
- x axis is the variable (e.g. birth weight), y axis is count or frequency or proportion (how many babies born with that weight)

## Visualization of Distributions {.smaller}

Histograms show spread as well as distribution shape.

- Which distribution might describe adult human height?
- Which distribution might describe age frequencies in the human population?
- Which distribution might describe median household income in USA?

## Normal Distribution Terminology Overload

- Normal
- Bell-Shaped
- Gaussian
- Standard Normal (mean 0, std 1)

## Z-scores {.smaller}

A linear transformation that converts data points into measures of how many standard deviations away the data is from the mean.

- data point is compared with mean
- the difference is normalized with respect to the standard deviation (division)
- z-score of 0 means that the data point is identical to the mean
- negative z-score means that the data point is smaller than the mean
- positive z-score means that the data point is larger than the mean

$$
z_i = {x_i - \bar x \over \sigma}
$$

# Stats in Practice

## Pandas Examples {.smaller}

::: incremental
- mean - df.mean() or df['column'].mean()
- median - df.median() or df['column'].median()
- mode - df.mode() or df['column'].mode()
- std - df.std() or df['column'].std()
- z-score - (df['column'] - df['column'].mean()) / df['column'].std()
- historgrams
  - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  - plt.hist(variable, bins)
