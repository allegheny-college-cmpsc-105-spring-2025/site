## Goals

::: incremental
- review of xlim and ylim
- understand the need for filtering
- understand the difference between limiting xlim ylim and filtering
- python fundamentals needed to understand everything
- an example of filtering vs xlim
- 
:::

<!-- this would go in a previous slide show

## comparing data

- what makes a valid comparison? 
- keep everything except one thing the same
- same x axis
- same y axis
- -->

## review of xlim and ylim

- manipulating these are super useful for exploration
- as you saw, they powerfully control the kind of interpretations that people make about data
- 

## What is Going on in Colab?

- **python interpreter** is running
- it knows how to execute lines of code
- it goes one line at a time (unless there are certain instructions to repeat or jump somewhere)
- 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
# Make pre-existing tools for data exploration available
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
# Make a pandas dataframe
dfm = pd.read_csv(
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2025/data-distortion-starter/refs/heads/main/data/data-distortion-noaa-2006-2020-USW00004843.csv',
    sep=',',
    names = ['INDEX', 'STATION', 'NAME', 'LATITUDE', 'LONGITUDE', 'ELEVATION',
       'DATE', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'HLY-TEMP-NORMAL'],
    skiprows=1
)
# 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-105-spring-2025/site/refs/heads/main/data/data-distortion-noaa-2006-2020-USW00004843.csv.csv',

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(dfm.head())
```
