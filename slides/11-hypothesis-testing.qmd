## Goals

- Standard Normal Distribution
- Single-sample vs multi-sample statistics
- Activity

# Standard Normal Distribution

## Standard Normal Distribution {.smaller}

- y axis is proportion
- x axis is z-scores, i.e. how many standard deviations away something is from the mean
- recall $z_i = {x_i - \bar x \over \sigma}$
- area under the curve is unity, 1 aka 100%

## Proportions vs Z scores {.smaller}

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- z-scores are on the x axis
- proportions above and below a certain z-score are the area under the curve
- what z-score boundary would separate 2.2% of the area in the right tail?
- 2

## Proportions vs Z scores {.smaller}

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- z-scores are on the x axis
- proportions above and below a certain z-score are the area under the curve
- what z-score boundary would separate 15.8% of the area in the left tail?
- -1

## Proportions vs Z scores {.smaller}

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- what $\pm$ z-score boundary would separate 4.4% of the area split between the right and left tails?
- $\pm$ 2
- Fancy way to ask the same thing: $\alpha$ is .044, $\alpha/2$ is 0.022, what is $z_{\alpha/2}$?
:::

## What is $\alpha$? {.smaller}

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- $\alpha$ is the greek letter used to talk about proportions of the data out of a total of 1.
- $\alpha/2$ is simple division, splitting the area in half
- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is asking for a z-score off the x-axis that sections off the requested area.
- if $\alpha$ is .05, what is $z_{\alpha/2}$?
- slightly less than 2

## Question 1

For a normal distribution, what is the probability of selecting a z-score that is larger than than $z = 1.96$?

## Z scores and Inferential Statistics

Z scores and the standard normal distribution are essential for inferential statistics.

::: incremental
- z scores make all data comparable
- the standard normal distribution has a fixed area of 1 and can be understood in terms of probability
- we can now ask formalized questions
- what z-score must some data have for it to only occur 5% of the time or less?
- n.b. 5% is a nice threshold which is commonly accepted as being statistically meaningful

# Single Sample versus Multi Sample Statistics

. . .

## Sample vs Population

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*83WLnE2QTeOHSjbPJDVKfw.png)

A `sample` of the human `population` might be everyone in this classroom, Alden 101. Another `sample` might be everyone in Alden 109. Another `sample` might be everyone in Brooks.

## Observations

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*83WLnE2QTeOHSjbPJDVKfw.png)

For each `sample`, there are multiple `observations`.

If I ask everyone in Alden 101 their birth weight, how many `observations` will there be in the `sample`?

## Sample Statistics {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Statistics like mean, median, mode, std are descriptive summaries of a sample of a population. 
- Statistics that come from a single sample are called a `sample mean`, `sample std`. But...
- The sample mean of birth weight in Alden 101 is likely slightly different than the sample mean of birth weight in Alden 109 right now!
- This means that there exists a distribution of sample means for birth weight!
- The hypothetical distribution of sample means is called the `sampling distribution`.

## Sampling Distribution

![](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/Statistics/sampdisgraphic3.jpg)


## Sampling Distribution Statistics {.smaller}

::: incremental
- the `sampling distribution` is conceptually from multiple samples, and has stats.
- the mean of the `sampling distribution` is the `expected value of the mean`
- the std of the `sampling distribution` is the `standard error of the mean`, $SEM$
- note that we can't actually measure multiple samples, we never see the sampling distribution
- mathematically and statistically, we can use it
- The central limit theorem states:
  - For any population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
    $\sigma$, the distribution of sample means for sample size N will have a mean of $\mu$
    and a standard deviation of $SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}$ and will approach a
    normal distribution as n approaches infinity, but N = 30 is close enough.
:::

## Sampling Distribution Shape {.smaller}

Note how the sampling distribution narrows as more observations (N) are used to make the sampling distribution

![](https://lsj.readthedocs.io/da/latest/_images/lsj_samplingDistDiffN.svg)

## Class Coin Exercise

- make a sample with three coin flips (heads = 0, tails = 1). Compute the sample mean with N=3
- make a sample with ten coin flips (heads = 0, tails = 1). Compute the sample mean with N=10

![](https://lsj.readthedocs.io/da/latest/_images/lsj_samplingDistDiffN.svg)

## Standard Error of the Mean {.smaller}

$$
SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}
$$

::: incremental
- recall, SEM is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
- SEM can be calculated from ONE SAMPLE
- It is desirable to have a small SEM because that would signify that the all the data are close to the true population mean!
- if N of the single sample is very large, the SEM will be small
- if $\sigma$ of a single sample is small, the SEM will be small
:::

## Question 2 {.smaller}

The population distribution of SAT scores is normal with a mean of $\mu = 500$. For a random sample of 25 students (N = 25) and a standard deviation of $\sigma = 100$, what is the probability
that the sample mean $\bar x$ will be greater than 540? Greater than 700?

- [Unit Normal Table for standard normal distribution](https://www.westga.edu/academics/research/vrc/assets/docs/UnitNormalTable.pdf)

. . .

for $\bar x = 540$, $p = 0.0228$, so it is quite unlikely for a sample of 25 students to get an average SAT score higher than 540.

## Z scores for one Sample in a Sampling Distribution

::: incremental
- assume the sampling distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}$
- assume the single sample mean $\bar x$
- recall that z-scored observations from single sample relate each sample to the sample mean $z_i = {x_i - \bar x \over \sigma}$
- $z_{sample} = {\mu - \bar x \over SEM}$
:::

## Making Confident Statements {.smaller}

- We can say with a set level of confidence that a single sample mean is within a certain interval, using the following formula:

$$
\bar x \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times SEM \\
SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}
$$

- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is a fixed number read off of a standard normal distribution when $\alpha$ is chosen.
- $\alpha$ represents the chance that we are wrong. It is a proportion of 1, usually, 0.05. 

## Confidence Intervals

- CIs are chosen by researchers, 95% confidence level is common choice.
- 95% CI refers to area under a Standard Normal Distribution and corresponds with $\alpha$ of .05
  
$$
CI = 100 \times (1 - \alpha)
$$

## Critical Z-value

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- if $\alpha$ is .05, $\alpha/2$ is 0.025 and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is 1.96
- if $\alpha$ is .01, $\alpha/2$ is 0.005, what is $z_{\alpha/2}$?
