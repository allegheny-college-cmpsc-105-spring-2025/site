# Single Sample versus Multi Sample Statistics

## Sample vs Population

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*83WLnE2QTeOHSjbPJDVKfw.png)

A `sample` of the human `population` might be everyone in this classroom, Alden 101. Another `sample` might be everyone in Alden 109. Another `sample` might be everyone in Brooks.

## Observations

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*83WLnE2QTeOHSjbPJDVKfw.png)

For each `sample`, there are multiple `observations`.

If I ask everyone in Alden 101 their birth weight, how many `observations` will there be in the `sample`?

## Sample Statistics {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Statistics like mean, median, mode, std are summaries of a sample of a population. 
- Statistics that come from a single sample are called a `sample mean`, `sample std`. But...
- The sample mean of birth weight in Alden 101 is likely slightly different than the sample mean of birth weight in Alden 109 right now!
- This means that there exists a distribution of sample means for birth weight!
- The hypothetical distribution of sample means is called the `sampling distribution`.

## Sampling Distribution

## Sampling Distribution Shape {.smaller}

Note how the sampling distribution narrows as more samples are used to make the probability distribution

- area under the curve stays at 1, or 100% chance

## Sampling Distribution Statistics {.smaller}

- the `sampling distribution` is conceptually from multiple samples, and also has stats.
- the mean of the `sampling distribution` is called the `expect value of the mean`
- the std of the `sampling distribution` is called the `standard error of the mean`, $SEM$
- note that we can't actually measure multiple samples, we never see the sampling distribution
- mathematically and statistically, we can use it...

## Standard Error of the Mean {.smaller}

$$
SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}
$$

::: incremental
- recall, SEM is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
- SEM can be calculated from ONE SAMPLE
- It is desirable to have a small SEM because that would signify that the all the data are close to the true population mean!
- if N of the single sample is very large, the SEM will be small
- if $\sigma$ of a single sample is small, the SEM will be small
:::

## Making Confident Statements {.smaller}

- We can say with a set level of confidence that a single sample mean is within a certain interval, using the following formula:

$$
\bar x \pm z_{\alpha/2} \times SEM \\
SEM = {\sigma \over \sqrt{N}}
$$

- $z_{\alpha/2}$ is a fixed number read off of a standard normal distribution when $\alpha$ is chosen.
- $\alpha$ represents the chance that we are wrong. It is a proportion of 1, usually, 0.05. 

## Confidence Intervals

- CIs are chosen by researchers, 95% confidence level is common choice.
- 95% CI refers to area under a Standard Normal Distribution and corresponds with $\alpha$ of .05
  
$$
CI = 100 \times (1 - \alpha)
$$

# Standard Normal Distribution

## Standard Normal Distribution {.smaller}

- y axis is proportion
- x axis is z-scores, i.e. how many standard deviations away something is from the mean
- recall $z_i = {x_i - \bar x \over \sigma}$
- area under the curve is unity, 1 aka 100%

## Critical Z Value {.smaller}

![](https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_standard_normal.svg)

::: incremental
- if $\alpha$ is .05, $\alpha/2$ is 0.025 and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is 1.96
- if $\alpha$ is .01, $\alpha/2$ is 0.005, what is $z_{\alpha/2}$?
