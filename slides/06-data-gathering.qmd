## Goals

::: incremental
- What **types** of data can you gather?
- What **sources** can data come from?
- How is data **stored** (for CMPSC 105)?
:::

# Data Types

Reading: [Types of Variables](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch8/5214817-eng.htm)

## Data Types

:::{.column width="100%"}
![](https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/national/data%2520types%2520examples.png)
:::

and numerical discrete!

## Categorical Nominal

::: incremental
- Name only, qualitative
  - car makes
  - zip code
  - eye color
- **Dichotomous variable** refers to a categorical nominal variables with only two values
  - left handed / right handed
  - current student / non student
:::


## Categorical Ordinal

::: incremental
- ordered, quasi-quantitative
  - agreement level
  - education level
- ordinal data can seem almost quantitative, but there is no way to know the value of the levels
- ordinal scales are usually used to measure non-numeric features like happiness, customer satisfaction
- **Likert Items** are often used to obtain categorical ordinal data
:::

## Likert Items

## Numerical Data

::: incremental
- Numerical data are quantitative
- **Discrete** means countable
  - number of students
  - number of views or likes
:::

## Numerical Data {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Numerical data are quantitative
- **Continuous** means measured
  - height must be measured
  - **Interval** refers to continuous data with no reference point
    - temperature, we know 28 F vs 33 F is a difference of 5, but does a difference of 5 mean the same thing between 100 and 105?
    - Interval data cannot be divided meaningfully. Don't compute what is 1/5 of the temperature today
    - Stats use division, causing a problem for interval data
  - **Ratio** refers to continuous data with a reference point
    - Height, weight, distance, speed
    - division or other ratios are meaningful. Professor Luman is twice my height!

## Practice

Recall an example for each data type

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

## Data Acquisition

Getting brand new data using surveys and sensors!

## Surveys for Acquisition

::: incremental
- surveys are directed toward people
- surveys answer subjective perceptual and behavioral questions, primarily
- different questions produce different data types
  - multiple choice questions
  - free response questions
  - slider ratings
  - Likert scales
:::

## Surveys for Acquisition

::: incremental
- Survey development should be guided by a hypothesis
- Only questions that have appropriate data types for analysis should be used
- Quality controls should be in place (e.g. timestamps, inclusion criteria)
- Data security protocols should be in place to protect private data
- Human Subjects Research must be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board
:::

Reading: [Surveys](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch14/spd_0001-eng.htm)

## Sensors for Acquisition {.smaller}

::: incremental
- sensors can measure inanimate objects/materials or people/animals
- electronic sensors for things
  - motion detection
  - freezer thermometer
  - tire pressure sensor
- sensors for people
  - motion capture
  - body temperature
  - electro-physiological
    - ECG - electrocardiogram
    - EEG - electroencephalogram
    - electrodermal
:::

## Sensors for Acquisition {.smaller}

## Acquisition Drawbacks

::: incremental
- time consuming
- data management is required (persistent storage, security)
- maybe the data already exist somewhere
- maybe surveys and sensors cannot answer the question you have
:::

# Extracted Data

## Extracting Data from Documents {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Documents often contain information but it is not in an analyzable format
  - Author names on research papers
  - Foreground of an image
  - Background of an image
  - Video transcripts of speech
  - Video transcripts of sounds
  - Cells (biology) appearing in images
  - Language structure
    - noun, verb, adj, conjunction,
    - word length
    - num vowels
    - num syllables
    - etc
:::

## Extracting Data by Web Scraping {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Scraping is gathering data form websites by reading into the html structure to get the content out of specific html tagged elements.
- Scraping tools exist to assist with formatting
  - Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
  - example with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadasu_no_Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadasu_no_Mori) 
:::

. . .

```python
import requests
# Making a GET request
r = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadasu_no_Mori')
# print content of request
print(r.content)
```

## Extracting Data & Storage

::: incremental
- extracted data must be entered into usable structures
  - databases
  - spreadsheets
  - plain text files
:::

## Drawbacks of Extracting Data

::: incremental
- data entry is time consuming
- data *should* be consistent, but real data is never perfect, so compromises must be made
- human errors can be difficult to detect
- data entry done with automated entry tools is hard to validate
- validation takes human time, or accepted inaccuracy
- arbitrary decisions may have to be made
:::

# Pre-existing Data

## Sources of Pre-existing Data

::: incremental
- [Tableau Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data)
- [Others](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uliFBPpcPtAoBczaGXCLgI00mMh7fUdTaObcTEnTtgw/edit?usp=sharing)
:::

## Drawbacks of Pre-existing Data

::: incremental
- Ethical collection practices may or may not have been used
- data have been used repeatedly in explorations leading to bias and overfitting on the data across explorations
- maybe the pre-existing data cannot answer the question you have
:::

# Data Storage for CMPSC 105

In this class, we store data in plain text CSV files

## CSV {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Comma-separated values format
- plain text file
  - readable and writable in many software programs
    - Google Sheets
    - MS excel
    - Notepad
    - Sublime Text
    - VS Code
:::

. . .

Reading [CSV Section 2.4 & 2.4.1](https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/get-data.html#csvs)

## CSV Activity

Make a CSV file based on this one image to explore this open question: Are healthy foods too expensive?

![](https://c7.alamy.com/comp/CNTYDX/tesco-shopping-receipt-CNTYDX.jpg)

How many different things can you imaging recording off of this one image?!

## CSV Activity Details {.smaller}

Start a Google Sheet. Include:

- Store Name
- Date
- Time
- Location
- Total number of items purchased
- Total number of non-food items purchased
- Total amount of "health" foods
- Total cost in USD
- Total cost of "health" foods
- Total cost of non-food items

## Submit your work to your Activities Repo

Use the name "data-gathering-activity.csv"
