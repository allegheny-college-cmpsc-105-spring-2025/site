## Goals

::: incremental
- What **types** of data can you gather?
- What **sources** can data come from?
:::

# Data Types

Reading: [Types of Variables](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch8/5214817-eng.htm)

## Data Types

:::{.column width="100%"}
![](https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/national/data%2520types%2520examples.png)
:::

and numerical discrete!

## Categorical Nominal

::: incremental
- Name only, qualitative
  - car makes
  - zip code
  - eye color
- **Dichotomous variable** refers to a categorical nominal variables with only two values
  - left handed / right handed
  - current student / non student
:::


## Categorical Ordinal

::: incremental
- ordered, quasi-quantitative
  - agreement level
  - education level
- ordinal data can seem almost quantitative, but there is no way to know the value of the levels
- ordinal scales are usually used to measure non-numeric features like happiness, customer satisfaction
- **Likert Items** are often used to obtain categorical ordinal data
:::

## Likert Items

## Numerical Data

::: incremental
- Numerical data are quantitative
- **Discrete** means countable
  - number of students
  - number of views or likes
:::

## Numerical Data {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Numerical data are quantitative
- **Continuous** means measured
  - height must be measured
  - **Interval** refers to continuous data with no reference point
    - temperature, we know 28 F vs 33 F is a difference of 5, but does a difference of 5 mean the same thing between 100 and 105?
    - Interval data cannot be divided meaningfully. Don't compute what is 1/5 of the temperature today
    - Stats use division, causing a problem for interval data
  - **Ratio** refers to continuous data with a reference point
    - Height, weight, distance, speed
    - division or other ratios are meaningful. Professor Luman is twice my height!

## Practice

Recall an example for each data type

# Data Sources

Reading: [Surveys](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/edu/power-pouvoir/ch14/spd_0001-eng.htm)

## Surveys

::: incremental
- Survey development should be guided by a hypothesis
- Only questions that have appropriate data types for analysis should be used
- Quality controls should be in place
- Human Subjects Research must be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board
- Based on the Google Form, what was wrong?
:::

## Sensors {.smaller}

::: incremental
- electronic sensors for things
  - motion detection
  - freezer thermometer
  - tire pressure sensor
- sensors for people
  - motion capture
  - body temperature
  - electro-physiological
    - ECG - electrocardiogram
    - EEG - electroencephalogram
    - electrodermal

## Scanners with sensors

::: incremental
- Scanners actively cause something to change to make measurement possible
  - fMRI
  - CT scan
  - others?
:::

## Images as Data

- MUSIC175/materials/20241126-drawing.maxpat
- Biology uses stains to for counting cells
- [Image fraud](slides/06-new-yorker.pdf)

## Sound as Data

## Time as Data
